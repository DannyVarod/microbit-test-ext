An experiment (beta) unofficial extension for MakeCode and micro:bit supporting multiple hardware extenions,
e.g. boards, sensors, servos, motors, enabling mixing the different modules together in one project.
I will copy the working blocks into a different stable repository (name TBD).

Currently includes support for (in development):

* Yahboom remote / game handle
* Kittenbot Powerblock / Armorbit
* Kittenbot Robotbit
